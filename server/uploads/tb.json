The three options include a high neckline, scoop neckline, and soft square neckline. The neckline expansion is for the front neckline of all views of the Zoey (cropped tank, hip tank and dress). The back neckline remains the same as the original Zoey pattern. It includes the expansion files for both the 0-18 and 14-32 size range. Simply download and use the files for the size range you need. Note that this is an add-on and therefore you must purchase the original Zoey pattern to use it. If you still need to purchase the Zoey pattern you can do so in two size ranges: 0-18 or 14-32.",
