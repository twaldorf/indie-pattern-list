The bodice for both views features a rounded, cut-on sleeve — choose between the large sleeve with an exaggerated rounded shape, or the small sleeve with a less dramatic silhouette. The bodice is shaped with darts in the front and a comfortable elastic waist in the back, and the neckline and outer sleeve seams are finished with our unique slot seam finish. Both views are finished with a traditional zipper and fabric zipper pull to make it easy to get on and off. View A is a dress with a midi-length straight-cut skirt, front darts, a bias-bound center slit, and curved front pockets.
