Their jackets are classic pieces that will stand the test of time and get better with age. The Field Jacket is Paynter's first make-your-own jacket pattern in collaboration with Merchant & Mills.\n\nAll paper patterns will include two woven labels, one is to be positioned inside the jacket near the hip and the other is a smaller label for the back neck. The larger label has been designed by @hello.ludio. Lucie’s design features the sun and the moon to represent time and getting lost in the practice of making. These labels are only available in the paper pattern, not PDF, and won’t be sold elsewhere.\n\nAll seam allowances are 1.5cm unless stated otherwise and are included in the pattern.\n\nSkill level; Advanced.\n\nFabric suggestions - We recommend light to medium weight wovens up to 8oz, cotton twills, denim, wool and dry oilskin. There are 9 layers to sew through during the pocket construction, so check the fabric you choose can be accommodated by your sewing machine.\n",

    "desc": "The Grove Creations PDF bundle is a set of 4 PDF patterns to make for the home. This project came about when we were renovating the Merchant & Mills house in Rye (The Grove) and wanted to use our fabrics but within a home setting. Your PDF includes:\n\nDuvet Set\n\nInstructions for making two duvet sets, one with concealed buttons and one with ties. Matching pillow slips, again either with buttons or ties. Included are options for single, double, king and super king. We recommend using our extra wide linen as this is 280cm wide, but we have included a formula if you are using narrower fabric.\n\nPillowcase\n\nInstructions for making a simple pillowcase with a deep envelope. Ideal as scatter cushions for the bed or sofa.\n\nQuilt & Sofa/Bed Topper\n\nInstructions for making a quilt or a topper for a bed or sofa. We designed this quilt as an ideal way to showcase our laundered linens, it’s very fun picking the combinations! The toppers are ideal for covering a sofa that your dog might want to keep jumping on, or toppers for wooden benches like we have in the pictures. The topper is made using self made fabric ties, and the quilt is made with lots of ties of linen thread. But these techniques can be interchangeable. We recommend using our Cloudwool wadding as it is the most sustainable wadding option we have found, recycled polyester is also an option if you want a light but more lofty quilt (we do not sell this). We also have this wool blend wadding which is much lighter weight but ideal if you have two thick fabrics to sandwich between. It is up to you how many layers of wadding to use.\n\nRelaxed Blind\n\nInstructions for making a simple draped roman blind. This type of blind is a more modern take on a traditional roman blind and very much suits a laundered linen for an informal look.\n\nAll seam allowances are 1cm unless stated otherwise and are included in the pattern.\n\nSkill level; beginner - intermediate.",
